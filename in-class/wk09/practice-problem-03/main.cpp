//Mod is back! Write a program to prompt a user for an integer and then pass the integer to a
//function dividesSelf() which returns true if it divides itself, false otherwise.
//We'll say that a positive int divides itself if every digit in the number divides
//into the number evenly. So for example 128 divides itself since 1, 2, and 8 all
//divide into 128 evenly. We'll say that 0 does not divide into anything evenly,
//so no number with a 0 digit divides itself. Note: use % to get the
//rightmost digit, and / to discard the rightmost digit. Add a loop in
//main() to keep prompting the user until they are done.
//
//dividesSelf(128) → true
//dividesSelf(12) → true
//dividesSelf(120) → false
